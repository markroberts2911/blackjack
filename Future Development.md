Here's a list of features I would like to develop:

Hit, Stick, Twist buttons 
    Hit - new card
    Stick - keep current hand, which will eventually play into... Dealer AI below
    Twist - Double down on one last card. Wouldn't have any distinction from Hit until Dealer and Gamble mechanics introduced.  

Dealer - AI that plays their hand after you stick - what I will use to decide if the player's win/loss/draw state.
    - they'll need their own part of the board. Will need to think about positioning
    - possible animations for drawing cards. 
    - 

Gamble mecahnics
    - Using those sweet credits to pit yourself against the Dealer. 
    - Store credits in console
        - Save Game button!?
